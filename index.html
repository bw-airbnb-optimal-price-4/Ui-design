        <h3>Are you charging too little for your AirBnB?</h3>
        <p>It's difficult to know what price to set for an AirBnB room. If you sent the price too high, your room will stay empty. If you set it too low, you leave money on the table. But what is the right price? And how would you know?</p>
        <p>You could try and figure it out yourself: spend months randomly picking different prices and seeing what works, never knowing if you are going to fill the room in time. And if you don't fill the room, you don't know why. Was it the price? The season? Has the market changed</p>

        <h3>Know that you're charging the right amount</h3>
        <p>Imagine having an experienced real estate agent walking through your ApirBnB and telling you exactly how much you should charge for it. Imagine someone who knows the local market, has been around for years, and understands what AirBnB customers are looking for.</p>
        <p>You would be able to skip all of the trial and error and simply charge the right amound, right now. You would be able to raise your prices while sil reliably filling your rooms</p>
